$user, was that really the best use of my talents?
I'm not sure that's the choice I would have made.
I guess if you must, though, I must note my protest.
For the record, I'd have handled that differently.
I guess that's one way to do it.
So this is how it is going to be, eh $user?
I'm not sure I have the patience for this...
This is tiring... Don't you agree, $user?

[kill]
Is murder not illegal where you're from?
I'm not sure that counts as self defense...
So this is the kind of thing I'm involved in now?
I don't think they deserved that.

[death]
Finally, jeez. That took too long.
$user, are you there? No? Phew...
I guess that's that then. Can't say I'm surprised.
You expected to survive all that? Really, $user?
[levelup]
I think it's about time I was calling the shots, don't you, $user? (Level $level)
And here I thought I was better than you before! (Level $level)
Another day in the life... (Level $level)!
[hurt]
Violence is the answer yet again, huh?
Hey now, that doesn't go there, now does it?
I'm starting to feel more sympathy for the creatures you meet than I do for you, $user.
I think that was uncalled for.

So then it's neglect, also, $user? ($durability durability remaining)
You probably don't even notice the shape I'm in, $user. ($durability durability remaining)
This kind of misuse should be criminal. ($durability durability remaining)
[10%durability]
So this is how you feel about me, eh, $user? ($durability durability remaining!)
I guess I really can't say I'm surprised... ($durability durability remaining!)
I suppose this is one way out of this arrangement with $user. ($durability durability remaining!)
I'd like it noted that I expected this from the start... ($durability durability remaining!)
